I am a **Computer Engineering student** with a passion for **Machine Learning, Natural Language Processing (NLP), and Full-Stack Development**. I enjoy building intelligent systems, exploring AI applications, and creating interactive web solutions. My projects reflect my commitment to learning and implementing modern technologies to solve real-world problems.

## Skills and Expertise

- **Machine Learning & Deep Learning**: Implementing models from scratch, fine-tuning pre-trained architectures, and working with frameworks like TensorFlow and PyTorch.
- **Natural Language Processing (NLP)**: Developing spelling correction systems, text classification, and language modeling.
- **Data Science & Analytics**: Proficient in **SQL, Excel, and Power BI** for data analysis, visualization, and business intelligence.
- **Web Development**: Building full-stack applications using the **MERN stack** (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js).
- **Geographic Information Systems (GIS)**: Experienced in **QGIS, Python, and Leaflet.js** for spatial analysis, mapping, and geospatial data visualization.
- **Data Visualization**: Creating interactive maps, dashboards, and reports using **Power BI, Matplotlib, and GeoJSON**.

## Notable Projects

- **Nepali Spelling Correction Using Transformer Models**: Developed an **NLP-based spelling correction system** for the Nepali language using Transformer models. Fine-tuned **mT5, mBART, and Varta-T5** to enhance spelling accuracy.
- **MERN Blog Website**: Built a **full-stack blog application** with authentication and CRUD functionality.
- **Nepal Hydropower Map**: Developed an **interactive map** displaying Nepalâ€™s hydropower projects.
- **Gallic War Map**: Created a **historical visualization** of the Gallic War events using interactive mapping technologies.
- **Amazigh Numbers Classification with ANN**: Designed an **Artificial Neural Network (ANN) model** to classify Amazigh numbers.
- **ML Models from Scratch**: Implemented **machine learning algorithms from scratch** without using high-level libraries.
